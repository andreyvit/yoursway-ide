# **** WORKAROUND ****
#
# This is workaround of the bug in PDEBuild: due to some unknown reason 
# launcherName parameter specified in .product does not map to the launcherName 
# variable in ant files generated from the .product file, so set it up manually.
#
# This should be removed once the bug is resolved.
#
# This bug should be reported to the Eclipse bugtracker :)
