The log4j-api-1.2.15.jar file contains only a small subset of the classes from
the full log4j-1.2.15.jar file found in the Log4J distribution.

This subset has been created purely to enable this project to compile without
the need to include the full jar file, which is quite large.

You will not find a file called log4j-api-1.2.15.jar in the Log4J distribution.
